**Text B The Language of Confidence**[[Microsof1\]](#_msocom_1) 

```
n 自信
adj  confident

```



**Pre-reading Questions**

*1.*     *Are there any words that make you feel confident or diffident?*

*2.*     *Do you believe that language can influence people’s thought? Give some example.*

The language we use **programs** our brain. **Mastering** our language give us a great **degree**  of **mastery** over our lives and our **destinies** . It is important to use the language in the best way possible in order to **dramatically** improve our quality of life.

```

Even the smallest of words can have the deepest effect on our **subconscious**  mind, which is like a child, and it doesn’t really understand the difference between what really happens and what you imagine. It **is eager to** please  and **willing to**  **carry out**   any commands that you give it--- whether you do this **knowingly**   or not **is entirely up to** you.

```
[subconscious]
adj. 下意识的;潜意识的

[be eager to]
渴望做某事

[Microsof10]
int. 请
vt. & vi. (使…)高兴; (使…)满意 （取悦某人）
想要; 喜欢

[be willing to]
愿意做某事

[carry out]

[knowingly]
adv. 会意地
故意地;着意地

[be up to]

```



**“Try”**

It is a small word yet it has an amazing **impact**  upon us. If someone says, “I’ll *try* to do that” you know that they are not going to be putting their whole heart into it, and may not even do it at all. How often do you use the word *try* when talking about the things that **matter**   to you? Do say “I’ll try to be more confident” or “I’ll try to do that” or “I’ll try to call”?

Think about something that you would like to achieve, and say it to yourself in two different ways. Firstly say, “I’ll try to …” and notice how you feel. Next say, “I will do …” and see how you feel.

The **latter**   makes you feel better than the first one, doesn’t it? It gives you a **sense**  of determination, a feeling that it will be done. Listen to the people around you and when they say they will try to notice if it gets done or not. **Eliminate** the word try from your dictionary and see how your life improves.

```
[impact]
n 巨大影响

[matter]
v 事关紧要

[latter]
adj. 后者的；较后的；近来的；后面的

[sense]
想象

[Eliminate]
vt. 消除, 排除忽略;淘汰;〈口〉干掉
```



**“Can’t”**

This is another small word with a big impact. It **disempowers**  us, makes us feel weak and helpless, and damages our **self-esteem**. It limits our **infinite**  abilities and **stifles**  **creativity** . **Rub** it out from your internal dictionary and replace it with something that makes you feel great.

```
[disempowers]
vt. 剥夺权力；力量剥夺；使失去影响力

[self-esteem]
自尊

[infinite]
adj. 无限的，无穷的；无数的；极大的

[stifles]
vt. 使窒息；扼杀；藏匿
vi. 窒息；被扼杀

[creativity]
创造力

[rub]
vt. 擦；摩擦；惹怒
vi. 摩擦；擦；擦破
n. 摩擦；障碍；磨损处
```



Instead of saying you can’t, why not say something like “I choose …” or “I choose not to …” Using words like this allows you to take back your power and to be in control of your life.

Words may appear small and **insignificant**[[Microsof26\]](#_msocom_26) , yet they have a deep and **lasting** [[Microsof27\]](#_msocom_27) effect on us. Mastering your language gives you the power to live whatever life you desire.

What words do you use a lot that disempower you? Make a list of words you commonly use and then write next to them some **alternatives** [[Microsof28\]](#_msocom_28) you can use. Make these alternatives words that make you feel **fabulous**[[Microsof29\]](#_msocom_29) , not only about yourself, but about life and what you are doing!

 ```
[insignificant]
adj. 无价值的, 无意义的, 无用的

[lasting]
adj. 持久的；永恒的
n. 厚实斜纹织物
v. 持续；维持（last的ing形式）

[alternatives]
adj. 两者择一的, 供替代的

[fabulous]
adj. 难以置信的；传说的，寓言中的；极好的
 ```
